# Product Vision & Stories

## Vision

Build a scheduling assistant that automates backlog-to-upload workflows so creators stay consistent with minimal manual effort.

## Principles

- Automation-first with clear human checkpoints.
- Heads-up visibility over low-level scheduling UI.
- Trust-building feedback loops (status, notifications, and previews).

## Epics and user stories

### Epic: Automated scheduling

- As a creator, I can set upload intervals on a settings page so the app auto-spaces my backlog.
- As a creator, I can apply common interval presets (e.g., 3/week or 2/day) to get started faster.
- As a creator, I can see a calendar heads-up view that highlights which days are ready vs need attention.
- As a creator, I can tap a date to see which videos are slated for that day and their readiness.

### Epic: Backlog readiness

- As a creator, I can see which backlog items are missing metadata so I can fix them quickly.
- As a creator, I can confirm a proposed schedule so I stay in control before anything posts.

### Epic: Notifications and nudges

- As a creator, I receive a notification when my backlog is empty so I know to add more videos.
- As a creator, I receive a notification when the next scheduled upload is yellow so I can fix missing details before it posts.
- As a creator, I can mute or adjust notification timing so reminders stay useful.

### Epic: Account/platform reliability

- As a creator, I can see account/link health so I know if uploads might fail.
- As a creator, I can retry failed uploads and see why they failed.

## Agile process (lightweight)

- Maintain a prioritized backlog with story points and acceptance criteria.
- Plan in 1–2 week sprints with a small, testable goal per sprint.
- Demo-ready at end of sprint with at least one user-facing improvement.

## Near-term sprint goals (proposed)

- Sprint 1: Heads-up calendar + dot legend + interval settings MVP.
- Sprint 2: Tentative scheduling logic + yellow/grey readiness rules.
- Sprint 3: Notification nudges for empty backlog and yellow next upload.

## Future plans

- Add a tutorial/app walkthrough that guides users through setting intervals, scheduling a video, and completing basic app flows.
- Add basic video editing within the app so users can record multi-clip videos
